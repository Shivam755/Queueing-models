# Queueing-models
A simple simulation program that takes the necessary values as input.

It consists of three files:

`Q.h` contains all the the structs and function declarations.

`Q.c` contains all the function definitions.

The above mentioned two files are just dependencies for `Qmodel.c`.

`Qmodel.c` is the main application file. This file is to be executed inorder to run the application.

For MacOs, Windows and Linux the screen will be cleared everytime. And for other operating Systems there will be a two line gap between two consecutive changes.
